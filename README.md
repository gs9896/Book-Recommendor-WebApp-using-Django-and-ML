# Book-Recommendor-WebApp-using-Django-and-ML
This project titled “Book Recommendation Engine” is developed using python Django-framework and Machine learning. The purpose of this Web App is to provide the end users of this site the result based on their interest. The books will be available to users after proper authentication so that they can get the books recommendation on the basis of what other users of similar taste read . So for recommendation correlation will be used , top rated books will be sorted using machine learning libraries and collaborative filtering will be done using KNN algorithm.

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems. However, it is mainly used for classification predictive problems in industry. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses ‘feature similarity’ to predict the values of new datapoints which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on how closely it matches the points in the training set.

We use Pearsons’R correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation between two variables, in our case, the ratings for two books.

This book recommendation system recommend books that are of buyer’s interest. Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend products to the end users that are most appropriate. This system uses features of collaborative filtering to produce efficient and effective recommendations. Collaborative recommender systems aggregate ratings of objects, recognize commonalities between users on the basis of their ratings, and generate new recommendations.
